Part of the code for my Campus Wall startup:
   1. Test the impact of two different 'like' button designs on user interaction (A/B testing).
   2. Build a 'Campus Activities' recommendation system to recommend other activities that users may be interested in based on their interests (collaborative filtering).
   3. Perform sentiment analysis on posts published by users to determine whether the posts are positive, negative, or neutral (NLP).
   4. Determine whether the post violates rules and requires manual review.
